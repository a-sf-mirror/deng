.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This manual page documents briefly the \fBdoomsday\fR command

.PP
This manual page was written for the Debian(tm)/GNU and Ubuntu(tm) distributions because the original program does not have a manual page\&. Instead, it has documentation in plain text format

.PP
\fBdoomsday\fR is an enhanced Doom(tm)/Heretic(tm)/Hexen(tm) engine, capable of running Doom 1, Doom 2, Evilution, Plutonia, Heretic, Hexen and Hexen: Deathkings\&. It currently CAN NOT run Freedoom, and does not support Boom features\&.

.PP
\fBdoomsday\fR supports high\-resolution textures and 3D models\&. Currently many of these can be found at http://eyagi\&.bpa\&.nu/~jamie/doomsday\&.html

.PP
These programs follow the Windows(tm) command line syntax\&. A summary of options is included below\&. For a complete description, see the text files and http://www\&.doomsdayhq\&.com\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-dedicated\fR
Run in dedicated server mode\&. No graphics or sounds will be initialized\&. The game will run in a text mode console\&.

.TP

.TP
\fB\-wnd\fR
Start the game in a window\&. By default the game runs in fullscreen mode\&.

.TP
\fB\-paltex\fR
Use paletted textures (if supported by the hardware)\&.

.TP
\fB\-playdemo\fR
After initialization loads the given demo file (which resides in the Demo subdirectory), plays it and then quits\&.

.TP
\fB\-timedemo\fR
After initialization loads the given demo file (which resides in the Demo subdirectory), plays it in singletics mode (i\&.e\&. as fast as possible), displays frame count information and quits\&.

.TP
\fB\-nosound\fR
Don't initialize sound or music\&.

.TP
\fB\-nomouse\fR

.TP
\fB\-texdir\fR

.TP
\fB\-texdir2\fR
Secondary high\-resolution (PNG,TGA,PCX) texture directory\&. Defaults to ""\&. This directory is checked first, so it can be used to override textures in the normal texture directory (\-texdir)\&.

.TP
\fB\-userdir\fR
Sets the working directory\&. By default the engine uses the current working directory (the one in which it was started)\&. On Debian/GNU and Ubuntu systems doomsday is run in a shell wrapper that sets \-userdir to $HOME/\&.deng automatically\&.

.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR
Be more verbose with console messages\&.

.TP
\fB\-texcomp\fR
Use texture compression (if supported by the OpenGL driver)\&.

.TP
\fB\-deh\fR
Applies the Dehacked patch\&. You can give more than one as arguments, e\&.g\&. "\-deh first\&.deh second\&.deh"\&.

.TP
\fB\-alldehs\fR
Allows the processing of more than one DEHACKED lump\&. Otherwise only the DEHACKED lump that has been loaded last is processed\&. Does not affect the \-deh option\&.

.SH "GAME"

.TP
\fB\-game\fR
Specifies the game to use (required)\&. This must be one of either jdoom, jheretic or jhexen eg "\-game jdoom"

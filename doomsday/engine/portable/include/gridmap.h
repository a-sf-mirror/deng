 * Gridmap. An abstract class designed for mapping objects into a two
 * dimensional spatial index.
 *
 * Gridmap's implementation allows that the whole space is indexable
 * however cells within it need not be populated. Therefore Gridmap may
 * be considered a "sparse" structure as it allows the user to construct
 * the space piece-wise or, leave it deliberately incomplete.

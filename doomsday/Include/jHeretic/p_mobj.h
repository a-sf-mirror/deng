/*
 * NOTES: mobj_t
 *
 * mobj_ts are used to tell the refresh where to draw an image,
 * tell the world simulation when objects are contacted,
 * and tell the sound driver how to position a sound.
 *
 * The refresh uses the next and prev links to follow
 * lists of things in sectors as they are being drawn.
 * The sprite, frame, and angle elements determine which patch_t
 * is used to draw the sprite if it is visible.
 * The sprite and frame values are allmost allways set
 * from state_t structures.
 * The statescr.exe utility generates the states.h and states.c
 * files that contain the sprite/frame numbers from the
 * statescr.txt source file.
 * The xyz origin point represents a point at the bottom middle
 * of the sprite (between the feet of a biped).
 * This is the default origin position for patch_ts grabbed
 * with lumpy.exe.
 * A walking creature will have its z equal to the floor
 * it is standing on.
 *
 * The sound code uses the x,y, and subsector fields
 * to do stereo positioning of any sound effited by the mobj_t.
 *
 * The play simulation uses the blocklinks, x,y,z, radius, height
 * to determine when mobj_ts are touching each other,
 * touching lines in the map, or hit by trace lines (gunshots,
 * lines of sight, etc).
 * The mobj_t->flags element has various bit flags
 * used by the simulation.
 *
 * Every mobj_t is linked into a single sector
 * based on its origin coordinates.
 * The subsector_t is found with R_PointInSubsector(x,y),
 * and the sector_t can be found with subsector->sector.
 * The sector links are only used by the rendering code,
 * the play simulation does not care about them at all.
 *
 * Any mobj_t that needs to be acted upon by something else
 * in the play world (block movement, be shot, etc) will also
 * need to be linked into the blockmap.
 * If the thing has the MF_NOBLOCK flag set, it will not use
 * the block links. It can still interact with other things,
 * but only as the instigator (missiles will run into other
 * things, but nothing can run into a missile).
 * Each block in the grid is 128*128 units, and knows about
 * every line_t that it contains a piece of, and every
 * interactable mobj_t that has its origin contained.
 *
 * A valid mobj_t is a mobj_t that has the proper subsector_t
 * filled in for its xy coordinates and is linked into the
 * sector from which the subsector was made, or has the
 * MF_NOSECTOR flag set (the subsector_t needs to be valid
 * even if MF_NOSECTOR is set), and is linked into a blockmap
 * block or has the MF_NOBLOCKMAP flag set.
 * Links should only be modified by the P_[Un]SetThingPosition()
 * functions.
 * Do not change the MF_NO? flags while a thing is valid.
 *
 * Any questions?

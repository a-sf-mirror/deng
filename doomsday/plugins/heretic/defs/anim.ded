# jHeretic: Additional Animation Sequences
#
# Heretic has predefined texture animation sequences.
# In order to remain compatible with existing WADs, jHeretic builds
# animations from these predefined sequences and creates texture
# animation groups for them. The flags "tgf_smooth" and
# "tgf_first_only" are set for each group.
#
# Additional sequences can be defined using Group definitions.

# jDoom: Values
# (mind yur speling; jDoom uses only the identifiers it knows about)
# 
# The strings from all Values definition blocks are merged together.
# This means you don't have to add all your values here; they can be
# in a Values block in another file.

Header { Version = 5; }

# The "Patch Replacement" values are used to replace patches with 
# strings of text. The replacement overrides any checks for external
# resources. Only patches in an IWAD can be replaced; this is required
# because existing PWADs may replace the original text patches with
# their own graphics.
#
# The replacement is done by searching a value in the "Patch 
# Replacement" block that matches the lump name of the patch to be 
# replaced. The text string may optionally contain parameters that 
# control how the string is displayed. The parameters must be placed
# inside braces. If a parameter block is present, the actual text 
# string begins from the first character following the closing brace. 
#
#   "{fonta, scale=2}C{scale=1}APITAL"
#
# Whitespace inside a parameter block is ignored. Use a comma or a 
# semicolon to separate parameters. The parameters and their default 
# values are:
#
#   fonta       Use the small font.
#   fontb       Use the large font (the default).
#   r=1.0       Red color component (0..1).
#   g=0.0       Green color component (0..1).
#   b=0.0       Blue color component (0..1).
#   x=0         Offset to the X coordinate.
#   y=0         Offset to the Y coordinate.
#   scale=1.0   Uniform scaling factor (both X and Y).
#   scalex=1.0  X scaling factor.
#   scaley=1.0  Y scaling factor.
#   angle=0.0   Rotation angle (around initial origin).
#   flash       Enable flashy type-in effect.
#   noflash     Disable it (the default).
#   case        Enable case-based scaling.
#   nocase      Disable it (the default).
#   ups=1.25    Upper case Y scale.
#   upo=0.0     Upper case Y offset.
#   los=1.0     Lower case Y scale.
#   loo=3.0     Lower case Y offset.
#   break       Start a new line.
#
# An example:

#   Patch Replacement {
#     M_DOOM = "{R=.5; G=1; B=.5; scale=3}G{scale=2;y=10}ONE {

* the first incarnation of the Doomsday UI theme, "Gradient", was 
  replaced with a much more polished theme, "Plastic"
* UI mouse cursor size and movement depend on display resolution
* music data will not be cached into the memory zone while loading

- removed obsolete settings from Control Panel
- removed detail texture maximum distance cvar and Control Panel slider
- removed cvars 'rend-light-clip', 'rend-light-shrink'

  blending for particles
+ particle generator flags "gnf_blendmul", "gnf_blendimul": normal and
  inverse multiplicative blending for particles
+ option -nohighpat: disable high-resolution patches
* weapon model skins are precached
* texture/flat groups can be used purely for precaching
* detail texture contrast is preprocessed: there will be multiple 
  instances of the same texture with different contrast levels (needs
  a bit more memory but allows faster rendering)
* 8-bit particle textures are interpreted as pure alpha data
* PCX images aren't loaded redundantly from virtual files

+ cvar 'rend-dev-wireframe': render player view in wireframe mode
+ cvar 'rend-dev-freeze': stop updating rendering lists (for debugging)
* renderer uses multitexturing for detail textures, dynamic lights,
  interpolated texture animation and model shiny skins
* shiny skins are correctly masked by alpha in main skin
* plane glow on models is stronger than before
* if multitexturing is available, masked walls will get one dynamic 
  light (previously masked walls were not lit by dynlights)
* dynamic light polygons are no longer clipped
* calculations to determine surfaces affected by a dynamic light are
  more accurate (light has a better chance to be visible)

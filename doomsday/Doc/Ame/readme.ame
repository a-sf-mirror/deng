@chapter{ Introduction }

The Doomsday Engine is an enhanced Doom source port for the Windows, 
Mac OS X, and Linux platforms. It is based on the source code of id Software's
Doom and Raven Software's Heretic and Hexen. The Doomsday Engine and
the associated ports of Doom, Heretic and Hexen have been under
development since 1999. The first versions were released in late 1999
and early 2000. Most of the development work has been done by Jaakko
Keränen (skyjake). Several other people have also been involved in the
project (see @ref{acks}{Acknowledgements}).
 
The purpose of the project is to create versions of Doom, Heretic and
Hexen that feel the same as the original games but are implemented
using modern techniques such as 3D graphics and client/server
networking. A lot of emphasis is placed on good-looking graphics.

@chapter{ Running from the Command Line }

@section{ File Paths on the Command Line }

There are a few things you should know about the handling of relative
paths. First of all, these are the directories that the engine is working
with:

@list{
@item Doomsday root/base directory (for example @file{ C:\Doomsday\ }).
	Everything relating to the Doomsday engine is under this directory.

@item Working/runtime directory (for example @file{ C:\Doomsday\Run\x\ }).
	This is the directory where the engine spends it time when a game
	is running.

@item Data directory (for example @file{ C:\Doomsday\Data\x\ }).
	WAD files and external resources are loaded from here.
}

The @opt{-basedir} option tells the engine where the base directory is in
relation to the runtime directory (or it's the the absolute path of the
base directory, e.g. @file{ C:\Doomsday\ }).

The principle is that @opt{-basedir} only affects built-in default paths and relative paths in DED files. @opt{-basedir} does not affect relative paths in command line options. If a relative path is given on the command line, it is first searched in relation to the runtime directory. For example, the option @opt{-file doom.wad} will make the engine read the file @file{doom.wad}, which is located in the runtime directory. In the default configuration this is @file{ C:\Doomsday\Run\jDoom\ }. If the file is not found in the runtime directory, the data directory is searched instead.

KickStart automatically uses a @opt{-basedir} of @file{..\..}, which means the root directory is the 'grandparent' of the runtime directory. The option @opt{-sbd} (@opt{-stdbasedir}) is the equivalent of @opt{-basedir ..\..}.

There is one exception, though. With the @opt{-file} (and @opt{-iwad}) options a relative path can begin with a greater-than character (>) or a closing brace character (@}). When the engine loads the WAD file in question, the > or @} character is replaced with the path specified by @opt{-basedir}. For example, @opt{-file >Data\Doom.wad} would make the engine load a WAD named @file{ C:\Doomsday\Data\Doom.wad } (assuming the default Doomsday root @file{ C:\Doomsday\ }). Note that if you're executing @file{Doomsday.exe} from the command line or from a DOS batch file, you must enclose the file names that contain a > character in quotes or otherwise DOS will think you're trying to redirect output. In response files it doesn't matter if there are quotes or not. (If you really are trying to redirect output, you should use the @opt{-out} option.)

The default launch method (used by KickStart 1.6) is a runtime directory oriented approach. KickStart will change the current working directory to the Game's runtime folder and execute @file{Doomsday.exe} from there, with the @opt{-basedir ..\..} option. This way the engine will use the appropriate runtime folder as the working directory, but will also know where the Doomsday root directory is by adding the base directory's @file{..\..} to default path names (like fonts and definitions files).

There is an alternative approach, which could be called an executable oriented approach. @file{Doomsday.exe} is executed in the @file{Bin} directory, with the options @opt{-userdir <runtime-path> -basedir <path-to-root>}. @file{<runtime-path>} can be a relative or an absolute path to the correct runtime directory. Again, @opt{-basedir} tells the engine where the root directory is, using an absolute path or in relation to @file{<runtime-path>}. @opt{-userdir} will make the engine run in the given directory, i.e. it specifies the runtime directory.

Note that @opt{-game} and @opt{-gl} work a bit differently because their arguments are directly passed on to the Win32 routine @cmd{LoadLibrary}. You should either omit the path entirely (e.g. @opt{-game jHeretic.dll}) or use a full path to the DLL (e.g. @opt{-game C:\Doomsday\Bin\jHeretic.dll}), no matter where you're executing @file{Doomsday.exe}.

The default place where you should put your IWADs is @file{ Data\<Game>\ }. jDoom, jHeretic and jHexen will by default look for IWADs in @file{ Data\<Game>\ }, @file{ Data\ }, the base directory and the runtime directory, in that order.



@section{ The @opt{-file} Option }

@a{fileopt}
The @opt{-file} option is used to load WAD files and other data files
from the command line. @opt{-file} has two aliases: the abbreviation
@opt{-f} and @opt{-iwad}. Both of these are just aliases; they are
treated like they were in fact @opt{-file}.

In addition to normal WAD files, the @opt{-file} option can be used
to load any type of data files, for instance PCX images. An example:

@samp{@opt{-file image.pcx}}

This would load the file @file{image.pcx} from the runtime directory (or the data directory). When loading files in this manner, the engine will treat the file as if it was a WAD file with a single data lump. The lump gets its name from the base of the file name, which in the example's case would be @file{IMAGE}. Anyone can then refer to the data lump using that name, just as if it was included in a WAD file.

Any file loaded with the @opt{-file} option can't be unloaded from
memory at runtime using the @cmd{unload} command. This is mainly a
precaution, since unloading the main WAD file of the game or any
data related to it would lead to fatal errors.



@chapter{ Data and Definitions Files }

@section{ PK3 Files }

Doomsday supports the PK3 (i.e. ZIP) format. Compression is allowed,
but encryption is not. If you try to load an encrypted or password
protected ZIP/PK3 file, you will get an error message.

PK3 files are loaded using the @opt{-file} option. For example,
@opt{-file some.pk3} will try loading @file{some.pk3} first from the
runtime directory and then from the data directory.

A PK3 contains a set of files organized into directories. When a PK3
is loaded, all of them become virtual files that Doomsday can access
just like the regular files on your hard drive. The end result is the
same as if you had unpacked the PK3 into your Doomsday base
directory. (Don't worry, no actual unpacking is done.) For example,
the PK3 could have the file @file{Data\jDoom\Auto\Superb.wad}.

PK3 files can be created with just about any ZIP program, such as
WinZip. Just make sure all the files have the correct paths, or
otherwise Doomsday may not be able to find them.

Version 1.8.6 introduces enhancements to PK3 path handling.

@list{

@item Files in the root of a PK3 are subject to automatic relocation
based on file name extension: PK3/ZIP/LMP/WAD are mapped to
@file{Data\<Game>\Auto\} and DED goes to @file{Defs\<Game>\Auto\}.  For
example, placing @file{test.ded} into the root of a PK3 has the same
end result as placing @file{test.ded} into @file{Defs\<Game>\Auto\}.

@item Since the automatic mapping described above only affects single
files, it is also possible to request mapping manually by adding a
special prefix character to the name of a directory in the root of a
PK3. If the directory begins with @file{#}, it is mapped into
@file{Data\<Game>\Auto\}; if it begins with @file{@@}, it is mapped into
@file{Defs\<Game>\Auto\}.

@samp{@file{#CoolStuff/Some.pk3} => @file{Data/<Game>/Auto/CoolStuff/Some.pk3}}

}



@section{ Definitions and Files in WADs }

After all DED files have been processed, the engine will check through all the loaded WAD files for lumps named @file{DD_DEFNS}. All the lumps with that name are processed just as if they were DED files, i.e. they should contain a DED file in plain text format. The @file{DD_DEFNS} lumps are applied in the order in which they have been loaded.

Another special lump used by Doomsday is @file{DD_DIREC}. It contains a table that translates file paths to lump names. An example is shown below:

@samp{
@pre{FILE001  /Md2/jDoom/Some.md2
FILE002  Another.ded}
}

Each line in @file{DD_DIREC} contains a lump/path pair. The paths that begin with a (back)slash are interpreted as paths that start from the Doomsday base directory (set with @opt{-basedir}; e.g. @file{C:\Doomsday}) and paths that don't begin with a (back)slash are located in the runtime directory. The engine will first search the @file{DD_DIREC}@nsp{s} before opening any file for reading. Note, however, that all kinds of files are not loaded using the @file{DD_DIREC}@nsp{s}: for instance demos (which are compressed with the LZSS library) must always be loaded from real files.

I've written a simple utility for automatically creating a WAD file that contains the current directory and all its subdirectories plus a @file{DD_DIREC} lump that has (with a high probability) a unique lump name for each file. You could invoke the utility like this:

@samp{@cmd{ wadtool myfiles.wad /Data/jDoom/Textures/ }}

This would create a WAD file that contains all the files from the current
directory. When writing the @file{DD_DIREC} table, the prefix
"/Data/jDoom/Textures/" would be added to each file name.



@section{ Automatical Loading of Data and Definitions }

All WAD, PK3, ZIP and LMP files placed in the @file{ Data\<Game>\Auto\
} directory will be automatically loaded at startup.  The data files
are loaded in alphabetical order, including all the subdirectories of
the @file{Auto} directory.

All DED files placed in the @file{ Defs\<Game>\Auto\ } directory will
be automatically read at startup.  The definition files are also
loaded in alphabetical order, including all the subdirectories of the
@file{Auto} directory.

Virtual files (from a PK3 or a WAD) in the @file{Auto} directories
will also be loaded.



@section{ Virtual Directory Mapping }

Version 1.8.7 introduces virtual directory mappings, which allows you
to make the contents of one directory appear inside another directory
at runtime.  For example, you could have a directory called
@file{MyAuto} with a set of data files somewhere on your hard drive.
You could map this directory to @file{Data/<Game>/Auto}, which would
cause @file{MyAuto} to behave as though it was an auto-loading
directory.

A virtual directory mapping is defined using the @opt{-vdmap} option.
It takes the source and destination directories as parameters.  For
example:

@samp{@cmd{-vdmap "D:\Games\MyAuto" "C:\Doomsday\Data\jDoom\Auto"}}

You can define an unlimited number of virtual directory mappings using
multiple @opt{-vdmap} options.

Note, however, that @opt{-vdmap} only affects real files. It does not
affect virtual files in PK3s or anywhere else.  The virtual directory
mappings are tried when all other methods of finding a file fail. So,
all real files and virtual files override @opt{-vdmap}.



@section{ Lump Assemblies instead of WADs }

The automatic loading of data files can be utilised to load
directories that contain individual data lumps.  This kind of a
directory is called a "lump assembly" and it can be used instead of a
WAD file.  Note that a lump assembly can only be loaded via the
autoload mechanism (but it can be inside of a PK3 that is loaded
manually).

By default the contents of a lump assembly are loaded in alphabetical
order.  However, some kinds of data require that the lumps are in a
specific order (for instance map data).  You have two options if you
want to enforce a specific order:

@list{

@item You can use name prefixes that are used to sort the lumps but
are ignored when the lump names are determined.  The length of the
prefix can be 1..9 characters long.  You specify the length of the
prefix by adding an extension to the name of the directory that
contains the lumps.  An example that uses a prefix with 3 characters:

@samp{@file{Data\Game\Auto\DirWithPrefix.3\01_LUMPNAME.lmp}}

The first three characters of the file name are ignored (@file{01_})
and @file{LUMPNAME} becomes the name of the lump. 

@item You can put a WAD inside the assembly.

}

The assembly can be built using a hierarchy of directories.  For
example the contents of the PK3 might be:

@samp{@pre{#assembly/
   data1.lmp
   data2.lmp
   powerplant.2/
      a-E2M3.lmp
      b-THINGS.lmp
   xyz.lmp
}}

@file{#assembly} would be mapped to @file{
Data\<Game>\Auto\assembly\ }.


@chapter{ Graphics }

@section{ 3D Models as Particles }

3D models can be used as particles in a particle generator. There are two things that need to be done. In the particle generator definition, set the particle stage's type to one of the @opt{pt_model} flags. The following would make the stage use particle model number 13:

@code{Type = "pt_model13";}

In the particle stage definition, remember to set a color for the stage. If the color is not specified, the default values will result in a completely transparent particle model.

The model definition must have a matching ID. For example, particle model number 13 uses the following ID:

@code{ID = "Particle13";}

For further details see the DED Reference.



@section{ Detail Textures }

Detail textures are grayscale images that are rendered on top of
normal textures when walls and planes are viewed from close by. A
signed-add blending is used, which lets the detail texture either
darken or brighten the underlying texture: black => dark, gray => no
change, white => bright.

Detail textures can be assigned to specific wall textures and flats
using Detail definitions (@file{Details.ded}). The definition is
described in the Doomsday Engine Definitions Reference
(@file{DEDDoc.txt}).

Detail textures can be loaded from external image resources (from the
@file{Textures} directory), or PCX images and raw image data stored
inside a WAD lump.  When using the @opt{-file} option to load detail
texture lumps, the file names of the images become lump names (see
@ref{fileopt}{@opt{-file} option}).

If an external resource is used as the detail texture, its dimensions
must be powers of two (for example 128x64 or 256x256).  The image file
must be in one of the supported image file formats.

PCX images used as detail textures must have a color depth of 8 bits
and their width and height must be powers of two. The palette should
be a grayscale one. It is possible to use other colors but the result
can be weird due to the way the blending of detail textures is done.

If the source data is a raw image, it must be either 64x64, 128x128 or
256x256 pixels in size. Raw images contain only the pixel values, (one
byte per pixel) and have only one color component per pixel (they're
black and white images), which means the lump or file that contains
the detail texture can either be 4096, 16384 or 65536 bytes long.

Using the default scaling, the pixels of detail textures are four
times smaller than the pixels of regular textures.

The console variables @var{rend-tex-detail},
@var{rend-tex-detail-far}, @var{rend-tex-detail-strength} and
@var{rend-tex-detail-scale} control the rendering of detail textures.



$ External resource files.
@chapter{ Resource Files }

Normally all resources such as wall textures, menu graphics and fonts, background music and sound effects are loaded from the WAD files. Doomsday has a mechanism that allows replacing these resources with external resource files placed in specific directories. The files are called
'external' because they are regular files and not part of a WAD file.

External resource files are easy to use. They do not require making changes to any configuration or definition files. As long as a resource file is placed in the correct directory, Doomsday will load and use it automatically.

External resources are divided into a number of classes. Each class has its own subdirectory under the @file{ Data\<Game>\ } directory. The table below lists the resource classes and gives a brief description of each.

@table{25 75}{
	@header{Resource Class} @tab @header{Description}
@row{single}
	Textures @tab Textures for walls and flats (floors and ceilings) @row
	Flats @tab Textures just for flats (floors and ceilings) @row
	Patches @tab Graphics for menus, fonts and sprite frames @row
	LightMaps @tab Textures for dynamic lights @row
	Music @tab Background music @row
	Sfx @tab Sound effects
}

For example, sound effects for jDoom would be placed in the directory @file{ Data\jDoom\Sfx\ }.



@section{ Game Modes }

One Game DLL, such as jDoom, is able to run in many different modes. Each mode emulates a specific version of the original game and typically has its own IWAD file. In some cases two modes can have a resource with the same name. This is a problem if the same resource file can't be used by both modes.

The resource class directory can have a subdirectory for each game mode. When Doomsday looks for an external resource, it first checks the current game mode's subdirectory. If no suitable resource is found there, the class directory is searched instead.

Below is a list of all the game modes supported by jDoom, jHeretic and jHexen.

@table{18 27 55}{
	@header{Game} @tab @header{Mode} @tab @header{Description}
@row{single}
	jDoom @tab doom1-share @tab Shareware Doom @row
	@tab doom1 @tab Registered Doom @row
	@tab doom1-ultimate @tab Ultimate Doom (has a 4th episode) @row
	@tab doom2 @tab Doom 2 @row
	@tab doom2-plut @tab Final Doom: Plutonia Experiment @row
	@tab doom2-tnt @tab Final Doom: TNT Evilution @row

	jHeretic @tab heretic-share @tab Shareware Heretic @row
	@tab heretic @tab Registered Heretic @row
	@tab heretic-ext @tab Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders (has episodes 4, 5) @row

	jHexen @tab hexen @tab Hexen @row
	@tab hexen-dk @tab Hexen: Death Kings of Dark Citadel @row
	@tab hexen-demo @tab The 4-level Hexen Demo
}

For example, textures meant only for Final Doom: Plutonia Experiment would be placed in the directory @file{ Data\jDoom\Textures\doom2-plut\ }.



@section{ Textures and Flats }

Normal wall textures and flats can be replaced with TGA (Truevision Targa),
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) or PCX (Zsoft Paintbrush) images. The
engine currently supports these image formats:

@table{40 20 20 20}{
	@header{Pixel size} @tab @header{PCX} @tab @header{PNG} @tab @header{TGA}
	@row{single}
	8-bit (paletted)* @tab Yes @tab Yes @tab - @row
	16-bit @tab - @tab - @tab - @row
	24-bit @tab - @tab Yes @tab Yes** @row
	32-bit (alpha channel) @tab - @tab Yes @tab Yes**
}

@caption{* = the palette does not have to match the palette of the game @br
** = TGAs must be type 2 (uncompressed, unmapped RGB)}

Note that 32-bit images are just 24-bit images with an additional 8 bits
per pixel for the alpha channel. Contact me if you feel that it's necessary
to add support for other formats.

The recommended format for high-resolution textures is paletted
PNG. It is the easiest format in which to distribute the textures due
to its small size. Since the palette doesn't have to be the same as
the game's, it should be enough for many textures.

The high-resolution textures can be of any size. The engine will
render them scaled so that they fit the size of the original
texture. This means the aspect ratio of the new texture doesn't have
to be the same as of the original texture. Note that the engine will
have to resize all textures so that their dimensions are powers of two
(e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256). This means TGA/PNG textures whose width and
height are already powers of two can be loaded faster.

Color keying is done if the file name of the image ends in "-ck", for
example @file{brnbigc-ck.png}. Both cyan (0,255,255) and purple
(255,0,255) are used as keys. An alternative way to have transparency
is to use an alpha channel. In it, white (255) means opaque and black
(0) is fully transparent. All values in between can be used, too, for
partly translucent pixels. When using an alpha channel, the "-ck"
suffix is not needed.

To create a high-resolution texture for the wall texture STARTAN3
you'd place a TGA file named @file{STARTAN3.tga} or a PNG file named
@file{STARTAN3.png} into the @file{Textures} directory.

The file names of images that replace flats must begin with "Flat-",
e.g. to replace the flat FLOOR7_2 you'd need to have a TGA file
@file{Flat-FLOOR7_2.tga} in the @file{Textures} directory. If there
are both PNG and TGA versions of the same texture, the engine will use
the PNG version.

Version 1.8.6 added the @file{Flats} external resource directory.  In
order to replace FLOOR7_2, it is enough to put @file{FLOOR7_2.png}
into the @file{Flats} directory; no prefix is necessary.

@notice{
	The file names of the high-resolution textures must match the
	@em{texture} names, not the names of the patches that make up
	the textures. For example: DOOR2_5 is a patch name, DOOR3 is
	the texture that uses DOOR2_5.
}

To disable high-resolution textures use the command line option
@opt{-nohightex}. The option @opt{-texdir} can be used to change the
directory from which the textures are searched.

Links to high-resolution texture sites:

@ind{
	@link{http://switch.to/doom2textures} @br
	@link{http://switch.to/heretictextures} @br
	@link{http://switch.to/hexentextures}
}

More texture-related resources are available at DoomsdayHQ:

@ind{@link{http://www.doomsdayhq.com/files.php?class=4&type=3}}



@section{ Patches }

Patches are images that are commonly used in game menus and intermission screens. Like textures, patches can be replaced with TGA, PNG or PCX images. The @file{Patches} resource class directory is searched using the lump names of the original patches. For example, to replace the Doom menu title, you would place the file @file{m_doom.png} to the @file{Patches} directory.

The original data lumps are required even if an external resource is found, because the original data includes information about offsets and the on-screen size of the patch. This means the image from the external resource can be of any arbitrary resolution: it will be scaled to match the original patch.

Currently external patch resources are not precached, which may cause slight delays when the patches are first loaded.



@section{ Sprite Frames }

Sprite frames are patches. They can be replaced with external resources just like all other patches. The same restrictions apply, though: the dimensions of the external resource do not affect the actual size of the sprite frame. This means the external resources must really be @em{high-resolution} versions of the original images. Otherwise the size and/or aspect ratio will not be right for the resource.

For example, in order to replace the Doom medikit (lump name MEDIA0), one would place the file @file{media0.png} into the @file{Patches} directory.

Color-mapped versions of sprite frames can have external resources, too. To indicate that a resource is color-mapped, its name is formed like this:

@ind{@file{(patchName)-table(classNum)(tableNum).ext}}

@file{(patchName)} is the sprite frame lump name. @file{(classNum)} is the number of the color translation class. This number is always zero in jDoom and jHeretic. In jHexen, it's the player's class (0=Fighter, 1=Cleric, 2=Mage). @file{tableNum} is the index number of the color translation table. jDoom and jHeretic have 4 tables, jHexen has 8. For example: @file{playa1-table01-ck.png} would be the Doom player sprite frame A1 with color table 1. The @file{-ck} suffix makes the image color keyed (i.e. special colors indicate transparent pixels).



@section { Raw Screens }

Some background pictures are in the raw screen format, which is used to store 320 x 200 pixel paletted images. A lump containing a raw screen image (for example Heretic's TITLEPIC) is exactly 320 x 200 = 64000 bytes long. Raw screens can be replaced with external resources in the @file{Patches} directory.



@section{ Light Maps }

Light maps are monochrome images that can be used with dynamic lights. The dimensions of a light map must be powers of two, for example 256 x 256. If the map contains an alpha channel, the actual color values are ignored; only the alpha values are significant. If the map doesn't have an alpha channel, one is generated by averaging the color values of the image.

Example: If you assign the light map "Round" to a light source, images with that file name are searched from the @file{LightMaps} directory. The accepted image formats are PCX, TGA and PNG. If @file{Round.pcx}, @file{Round.tga} or @file{Round.png} is found, it will be loaded.



@section{ Music }

Doomsday can play various external music files using the FMOD library
(@link{http://www.fmod.org/}). FMOD supports many music file formats including MP3, OGG, MOD and S3M (mods are a good choice due
to their good quality/size ratio). External music files can be played at
any time using the @cmd{playext} console command.

	On some systems, using FMOD with Doomsday has caused lock-ups or other unwanted behavior. If this appears to be the case for you, you should disable FMOD with the @opt{-nofmod} option. However, this will also make it impossible to play external music files such as MP3s.
}

Like other external resources, placing a music file into the @file{Music} resource class directory is enough. The file name must match the lump name of the original music data lump. For example, to replace the music for Doom's first episode's second map, the file @file{d_e1m2.mp3} would be placed in the @file{Music} directory.

It is also possible to store music files into a WAD. Again, you must name the lumps so that they match the lumps of the original songs, and are thus loaded instead of them. Any music files supported by FMOD can be loaded from a WAD.

Another way to specify an external resource file is to use the @opt{Ext} key of a Music definition (in Audio.ded). An example of editing the definitions: You have a terrific song called @file{song.mp3} and you'd like to hear it instead of Doom's regular "e1m2".

@list/enum{
@item The first thing to decide is whether you want to play the
song from where it's currently located, or do you want to move it under
the Doomsday directory. In the latter case it would be easy to
distribute the song and its definition file to others, since they
wouldn't have to worry about where the music file is. If you decide
to move the song, create a directory under the @file{ Doomsday\Data\jDoom\ } directory called @file{Music}. Another logical choice could be
@file{ Doomsday\Music\ }. Then copy the song into the created directory.

@item Open @file{Audio.ded} in a text editor. In it, you will find
a bunch of Music definitions, including:

@code{Music @{ ID = "e1m2"; Lump = "D_E1M2"; @} }

In order to make the change persist over version upgrades (each one will overwrite @file{Audio.ded}) copy the definition to @file{User.ded} in the @file{ Defs\jDoom\ } directory, or create a new DED file with any name you like in the @file{ Defs\jDoom\Auto\ } directory. Everything in the @file{Auto} directory will be read automatically. If @file{User.ded} doesn't exist, just create a new file for it.

@item Now you have the new Music definition, and the only thing left is to let the engine know which file it should load when the song "e1m2" is played. Edit your definition by adding the @opt{Ext} key:

@ind{@pre{Music @{
  ID = "e1m2"; Lump = "D_E1M2";
  Ext = "Data\jDoom\Music\song.mp3";
@}}}
}

CD tracks can be associated with songs in a similar fashion, but
instead of using the @opt{Ext} key you should use a @opt{CD track}
key:

@code{CD track = 3;}


@section{ Sound Effects }

Sound samples can be replaced with WAV files. The supported formats are 8-bit and 16-bit mono PCM with no compression. The @file{Sfx} resource class directory is searched using the lump names of the original samples. For example, to replace jDoom's rocket launcher sound, the file @file{dsrlaunc.wav} would be placed in the @file{Sfx} directory.

Another way to specify an external resource file is to use the Sound definition @opt{Ext} key.

Doomsday will automatically detect the format of a sample if it's loaded from a WAD file, making it possible to compile a WAD out of WAV samples.



@chapter{ Plugins }

@section{ glBSP Map Loader }

It is no longer necessary to run glBSP manually on WAD files because 
Doomsday now includes glBSP as a plugin that is run automatically when 
needed. The glBSP source code is from version 1.96.

The following console variables control how dpMapLoad works:

@deflist{
@item{ @var{bsp-build} }
	This is the master switch that either enables or disables the map loader
	plugin. If set to zero, GL BSP data is read from any loaded GWA files and
	the glBSP builder in the plugin is not used. 

@item{ @var{bsp-cache} }
	Determines if cached BSP data from the @file{bspcache} directory should
	be used if it passes the last modification time test. If set to one, 
	any suitable data from the @file{bspcache} directory is loaded and no new
	data needs to be calculated. If set to zero, the plugin will always 
	calculate new BSP data and store it in the cache.
	
@item{ @var{bsp-factor} }
	Sets the cost glBSP assigns to seg splits. The default value is 7. 
}

The generated GL BSP data is stored in the @file{bspcache} directory. 
There are subdirectories for each game mode and WAD. You are free to 
delete the cache directory at any time.


@section{ Dehacked Patches }

Most features of Dehacked are supported by Doomsday's Dehacked reader.
The loader will print a message during startup if an unsupported
feature is used.

Let's say you have the Dehacked patch @file{file.deh} in your runtime
directory. Then you can use the command line option
@opt{-deh file.deh} to load it at startup.

If a lump named @file{DEHACKED} is found in a WAD, it will be
automatically applied when the WAD is loaded. Normally only the last
@file{DEHACKED} lump is used if a lump with that name is found
in multiple WADs. Use the option @opt{-alldehs} to make the engine
apply all found @file{DEHACKED} lumps.



@chapter{ Networking }

Doomsday uses both TCP and UDP for making network connections.  If you
are behind a firewall or you are using NAT, you must make sure that
other computers are able to send network packets to your computer.
This entails opening the appropriate incoming TCP/UDP ports on your
firewall and/or configuring the NAT so that the correct ports are
routed to your computer.

All the TCP/UDP ports that Doomsday will use (in a basic setup where
there is either one server or one client on a computer) are visible in
the network setup screens. The corresponding console variables are
@var{net-port-control} (TCP) and @var{net-port-data} (UDP).

@section{Server Settings}
 
The server uses one TCP port for listening to incoming connections. By
default this is 13209 (setting the port to zero will mean 13209 will
be used instead). This port must be open for incoming TCP traffic.
 
The server also uses one UDP port of listening to incoming data
messages from the clients. By default this is port 13209 (the same
number as with TCP). This port must be open for incoming and outgoing
UDP traffic.
 
@section{Client Settings}
 
The client uses one UDP port for data messages. By default this is
13209 (just like the server). This port must be open for incoming and
outgoing UDP traffic.



@chapter{ Known Issues }

@list{
@item The list of reported bugs is on the deng Project page on SourceForge:
	@link{http://sourceforge.net/projects/deng/}

@item Display color adjustments (gamma, contrast, brightness) are
	currently not functional in Linux.

@item The FMOD library has been known to cause problems on some systems.
	If you experience sudden crashes or lock-ups, try the @opt{-nofmod}
	option. It may also be helpful to disable MIDI music entirely
	with the @opt{-nomusic} option.

@item Software gamma doesn't affect MD2 skins. Use hardware gamma
	correction (@var{vid-gamma}, @var{vid-contrast}, @var{vid-bright})
	instead.

People who have sent bug reports. One can't expect me to keep coding this
thing and test every possible level in case something has broken down...
(Did you know that Doom, Heretic and Hexen combined have over 220
'official' levels?) By sending bug reports you can be sure I'll at least
try to fix it some day. :-)

People who have sent ideas for new features. My goal is not to create the
most feature-packed, super-customizable FPS extravaganza but to have ports
of Doom, Heretic and Hexen that play right and look nice, so I might not
think of something you'd very much like to see.

All DOOM / Heretic / Hexen fans, for keeping these excellent games alive.
Keep on playing!

Me, Jaakko Keränen, for writing this stuff! You rule! ;-D

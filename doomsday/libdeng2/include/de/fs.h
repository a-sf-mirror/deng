     * The file system maintains a tree of files and folders. It provides a way
     * to quickly and efficiently locate files anywhere in the tree. It also
     * maintains semantic information about the structure and content of the 
     * file tree, allowing others to know how to treat the files and folders.
     *
     * In practice, the file system consists of a tree of File and Folder instances.
     * These instances are generated by the Feed objects attached to the folders.
     * For instance, a DirectoryFeed will generate the appropriate File and Folder
     * instances for a directory in the native file system. 
     *
     * The file system can be repopulated at any time to resynchronize it with the
     * source data. This is needed for instance when native files get deleted 
     * in the directory a folder is feeding on. The feeds are responsible for
     * deciding when instances get out-of-date and need to be deleted (pruning). 
     * Pruning occurs when a folder that is already populated with files is repopulated.

     * The memory zone allocates raw blocks of memory with low overhead.
     * The zone is composed of multiple memory volumes. New volumes are allocated
     * when there is no space left on the existing ones, allowing the memory zone
     * to grow at runtime.
     *
     * When fast malloc mode is enabled, memory volumes aren't checked for purgable
     * blocks. If the rover block isn't suitable, a new empty volume is created
     * without further checking. This is suitable for cases where lots of blocks
     * are being allocated in a rapid sequence, with no frees in between (e.g.,
     * map setup).
     *
     * Sequences: The MAP_STATIC purge tag has a special purpose.
     * It works like MAP so that it is purged on a per map basis, but
     * blocks allocated as MAP_STATIC should not be freed at any time when the
     * map is being used. Internally, the map-static blocks are linked into
     * sequences so that Z_Malloc knows to skip all of them efficiently. This is
     * possible because no block inside the sequence could be purged by Z_Malloc
     * anyway.
     *
     * There is never any space between memblocks, and there will never be
     * two contiguous free memblocks.
     *
     * The rover can be left pointing at a non-empty block.
     *
     * It is of no value to free a cachable block, because it will get
     * overwritten automatically if needed.
     *
     * Define LIBDENG2_FAKE_MEMORY_ZONE to force all memory blocks to be allocated from
     * the real heap. Useful when debugging memory-related problems.

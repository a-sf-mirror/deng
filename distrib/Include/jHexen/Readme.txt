There are two ways to use this PK3:

1) Put it in the directory Data\jHexen\Auto\. The PK3 will be 
   automatically loaded when you start jHexen.
   
2) Put it in the directory Data\jHexen\ and use the -file command 
   line option to load it: "-file name.pk3"

The files in the PK3 can be extracted using any ZIP extract utility.
If you want to use the files with Doomsday, extract to the Doomsday
base directory.
